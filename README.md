# React + Vite - boilerplate: ready to clone

## About

It comes pre-configured with all the necessary tools and packages, such as routing and styling. I believe that this will be a life-saver for developers who want to get started quickly without worrying about the initial setup.

I created this project with a simple and easy-to-use starting point in mind. It is my hope that this will be a helpful resource for you as you begin your project. So, feel free to clone this repository and start building your web app right now!
